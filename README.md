# Env-KB60F
 Another Custom Mechanical Keyboard... F stands for FOREHEAD!

### Why?
I may or may not be addicted to designing things in kicad but thats a topic we'll discuss another time...

Ive decided Im going to try to keep working on a GH60 compatible 60% but I also want something a bit more like a CFTKB Discipline, I generally like having a diode stack seperate from the key switches.


### DETAILS
This will be a standard 60% ISO layout so you should be able to get a generic 60% plate made or bought and It'll fit.

Once again we'll use the RPI PICO and KMK for now and also Ill eventually get around to adding SVGs/DXFs for laser cut cases.
