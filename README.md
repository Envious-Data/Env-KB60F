# Env-KB60F
 Another Custom Mechanical Keyboard... F stands for FOREHEAD!

![PCBShot](Env-KB60F.png)


### Why?
I may or may not be addicted to designing things in kicad but thats a topic we'll discuss another time...

Ive decided Im going to try to keep working on a GH60 compatible 60% but I also want something a bit more like a CFTKB Discipline, I generally like having a diode stack seperate from the key switches.


### DETAILS
Right so as of right now with current progress on this project:
- ISO/Ansi support!
- Sandwich Case needs to be worked on some but I have atleast the plate done.

- Getting PCBs made.
- Building and tesing of KB and creating the keymap.
