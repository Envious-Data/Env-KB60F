 Project Name: KB60F
 Nickname: Terminus

![PCBShot](Env-KB60F.png)


### About!
This is a simple-ish 60% design using a Raspberry Pi Pico. Its a standard 60% layout supporting ANSI and ISO.

Optionally if you have your own PCBs made you can use some pogo pins with a 1mm post to connect the TP pads on the underside of a raspberry pi pico, This will allow functionality of the USB type-c port if populated.


### DETAILS
Right so as of right now with current progress on this project:
[x] ~~ISO/Ansi support!~~
[x] ~~Sandwich Case needs to be worked on some but I have atleast the plate done.~~

- Getting PCBs made.
- Building and tesing of KB and creating the keymap.
